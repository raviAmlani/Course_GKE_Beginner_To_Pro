======== VPC ===========

Region
	VPC
	Availability Zones
		Subnets
VPC cannot span across regions
Subnets cannot span across Availability Zones

CIDR and IP Address subnets

Implied Router
	For communication between subnets
	Logical router
	We get it automatically
	
Route Tables
	50 entries max
	200 tables max
	
Subnet Association to Route Table
	If no association then it associates with the "main(VPC) route table"
	One route table can be associated with multiple Subnets
	One Subnet can only be associated with one route table
	Subnet's association can be modified from one route table to another.
	One default entry in the route table is for bigger VPC CIDR block - for all the subnets with Target as Local.
	
VPC/Main/Default route table
	you can modify the entries but you cannot delete the main route table.
	you can change the flag and make any other route table a main route table.
	you cannot modify the default rule of main route table which allow all vpc 
		subnets to communicate with one another.
		ex. 10.0.0.0/16
	
VPC IP Addressing
	CIDR - Class-less inter domain routing
	RFC1918 CIDR Block range - which cannot be modified after creating VPC
	Minimum size of CIDR block on VPC is /28 which is very small and max is /16.
		meaning, out of 32 bits, 28 bits for network and 4 bits for host, subnets, EC2 instances etc. 
	To modify the VPC, 
		one option is to create another vpc and migrate everything from older to the newer one. 
		second option is, to add the secondary CIDR block which doesn't overlap with your existing cidr block. 
			check the information page on aws website. 
			ex. if your primary cidr is 10.0.0.0/24 then you cannot add anything bigger than that
			but smaller ranges are allowed ex. 10.0.0.0/25 to 28
		Upon doing the second option, automatic entries are added to the route tables, 
			with target as local and destination as your new CIDR.
			
Reserved IP's in each subnet:
	First 4 and last IP's are reserved.
	Ex. of 10.0.0.0/24 - we have 0 to 255 IPs. 
		10.0.0.0 - base network
		.1 - VPC router
		.2 - DNS related
		.3 - reserved for futuer use
		.255 - future use probably
	
Internet Gateway
	VPC can connect to Internet and other AWS Services using this Gateway.
	Horizontally scaled, redundant, highly available service/VPC component.
	Only one IG per vpc.
	Cannot be deleted if attached to VPC
	It does NAT (network address translation) between your private and public IPv4 addresses. 
	
Public Subnet and Private Subnet:
	Private ranges are as below. Any companies can choose any of these ranges.  
		10.0.0.0
		172.16.0.0
		192.168.0.0
	Public ranges are - Publicaly exposed IPs which can be located by all the routers over the internet. 
	
Security Groups
	Virtual Firewall to protect the servers defined within VPC
	Defence in-depth
NACL
	Network Access Control Lists
	Works at VPC level - First line of defence
	
Virtual Private Gateway
	
----------

Two types of VPC:
1. Default VPC
	One per region, auto created
	Comes with default CIDR, N ACL, Security Group, Route table settings
	Has internet gateway by default
2. Custom VPC
	VPC which we create
	We can decide the CIDR
	Has default Security Group, N ACL and Route tables
	No internet gateway by default, we need to create if needed
	
-----------

Security Groups:

Virtualization/Hyperviser on the host emulates the CPU, Memory, NIC and Disk
	to install the Guest OS.
XEN Virtualization

Virtual NIC (Network interface card) is called ENI (Elastic Network Interface) in AWS

SG works at ENI level of EC2.
	Anything coming in/out to/of EC2 instance is called inbound/outbound of EC2.

SG is a virtual firewall
It controls the traffic at EC2 instance level, specifically at ENI level
Upto 5 SGs allowed per EC2 instance
We can only define allow rules, not the deny rules
There is an implicit deny rule 
It is stateful - if any traffic is allowed by inbound rule,
	ex. request to see the webpage, so the return traffic of such req is allowed even if there is no rule to allow it.
SGs are directional
 
===================================

Amazon s3 Transfer Accelaration

Glacier - retrieval unit
1 unit - 3 retrieval with 150 MB/s on every 5 minutes

Lambda 
total invocation requests, latency, and error rates, 
the throttles, Dead Letter Queues errors and Iterator age

Standard queues provide at least once delivery
FIFO provides at least once processing

By default, 
Auto Scaling is not enabled in a DynamoDB table which is created using the AWS CLI.

S3 upload limit:
Largest object that can be uploaded using single PUT is 5 GB
but with multipart upload it is 5 TB

R 53:
Failover routing policy: Active-passive
Other policies: Active-Active

Active-Active Failover uses all available resources all the time 
without a primary nor a secondary resource.

ElastiCache improves the performance of your database 
through caching query results.

Classic Load Balancer, the default for cross-zone load balancing depends on how you create the load balancer.
SDK or CLI - disabled
Console - enabled
If enabled, distributes the traffic equally among all nodes.
If disabled, distributes the traffic equally among all AZs.

Read replicas provides elasticity to your RDS DB

If instance is preparing to hibernate 'stopping' - billed
if preparing to stop 'stopping' - not billed
Terminated but reserved instance - billed until the end of payment term

Does updating an ASG with new Launch Configuration affect existing EC2 instances?
